# The Australian School of Excellence
**Things I like that I think New Zealand should steal** 
- Senior Marking
  - This was pretty fun and got us to pretend to be the IMO committee which is pretty fun.
- Prep Problems ( I love having these prep problems, but I don't like how much of the AUS camp is about going through the prep problems)
  - I think the best way to improve really is just to do more problems
- Lectures tend to be more focussed on solving problems rather than theory

**Things which I did not like that New Zealand does well**
- no internet lol wtf is that

Damn this wasn't really the once in a lifetime experience like the IMO :/ :(
